# feelz 📖

A terminal-based journaling tool built with Go and Bubble Tea. Feelz gives you a calm, focused space in your terminal to reflect on your day using guided prompts.

Feelz outputs as a simply formatted markdown file, readily compatible with your favorite note-taking applications like [Obsidian](https://github.com/obsidianmd). Modify the templates/daily.md markdown file to add your own formatting, or the config.json to specifiy an output directory.

## Features

- **Guided journal prompts** — Choose from default prompts like "Today's Thoughts", "Gratitude", and "Media Diet", or define your own!
- **Interactive TUI** — Clean, keyboard-driven interface powered by Bubble Tea
- **Markdown output** — Your entries are automatically formatted and saved as Markdown files using an embedded template
- **Auto wrap-up** — After completing your session, feelz wraps things up, outputs your markdown, and exits cleanly after a brief countdown

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) 1.25+ installed.

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neeeb1/feelz
cd feelz
go build -o feelz .
./feelz
```

Or run directly without building:

```bash
go run .
```

## Usage

When you launch feelz, you'll land on the prompt selector screen. Use the arrow keys (or `j`/`k`) to navigate, and press `Enter` or `Space` to select prompts. Once you've selected the prompts you want, navigate to **Get started** and press `Enter` to begin.

During a session, you'll be presented with each prompt one at a time with a text area to write in. When you're done with a prompt, press `Ctrl+N` to move to the next one. After completing all selected prompts, feelz will format your entries into a Markdown file. By default, this is saved to the `out/` directory.

**Keyboard shortcuts:**

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑` / `k` | Move cursor up |
| `↓` / `j` | Move cursor down |
| `Enter` / `Space` | Select/deselect prompt |
| `Ctrl+N` | Submit current entry and continue |
| `Esc` | Unfocus textarea |
| `q` / `Ctrl+C` | Quit |

**Note:** Make sure the `out/` directory exists before running, as feelz writes your journal entries there:

```bash
mkdir -p out
```

## Customization

You can update feelz with new journal prompts by modifying the config.json file. Each journal prompt needs a name, the prompt text, and an optional placeholder text.

You can also update the format of the markdown output by modifying templates/daily.md.

## Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [Go](https://golang.org/) | Core language |
